Manufacture the Discs with a special asymmetric heat treatment to made the Edge in tension at room temperature, and the center in compression. This can be done by getting the edge of the disks Very Hot and then cooling rapidly while being pressed between 2 flat Reference SUrfaces (stone or low thermal-expansion metal). Make a ring shaped torch to only heat the edge, and use an insulator to block the flame from heating the center. When the disks are at room temperature the outer edge will be in Tension and the center in compression. When the disc gets up to operating temperature due to steam, the outer edge expands more relieving the stresses, and the center heats less so, relieving the tension & becoming perfectly flat.
