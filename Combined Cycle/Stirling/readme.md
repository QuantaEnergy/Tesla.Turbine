# Rankine Top + Stirling Bottom Cycle.
A Tesla Steam Turbine with a condenser coil & full recirculation loop (Rankine Cycle) still wastes a lot of energy: all of the steam's Heat of Vaporization is lost in the condenser coil cooling loop/radiator and Doesn't do any work. This is perfect for a sealed Stirling Engine to get further efficiency.

Construct the condenser coil to wrap around the Stirling Engine's Hot Cylinder wall, or even multiple stirling engines in series, much like a Triple-Expansion Steam Engine. (will a Low Temperature Differential improve it?) This way, when the Steam condenses back to water it will deposit all it's Enthalpy of Vaporization directly on the Stirling engine's cylinder, which is maximally efficient.

# Enthalpy of Vaporization
Raising 1 gram of water from 25°C to 100°C takes 75 Calories. But boiling it to steam takes **540 Calories!** - almost 7.5× as much energy. This is to much energy to waste.
